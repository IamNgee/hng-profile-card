                            <p> Hello! I’m <strong>Ngiate Okpa</strong>,
                                 a passionate frontend developer who loves creating clean,
                                  accessible, and user-friendly digital experiences.
                                    I enjoy turning ideas into functional and visually engaging websites.
                                    When I’m not coding, I spend time reading,
                                     exploring new tech tools, or listening to music.
                            </p>

                            <p>My primary goal in this program is to strengthen my understanding
                                 of frontend frameworks, improve my problem-solving skills, 
                                 and learn to collaborate effectively on large-scale projects.
                                I also aim to refine my design-to-development workflow to produce cleaner, 
                                more maintainable code.</p>

                                 Keep learning, stay curious, and never let imposter
                                  syndrome stop you from building amazing things.
                                You’re capable of more than you realize — keep creating and inspiring.</p>

                            <p>I believe technology should empower people,
                                 not overwhelm them.
                                As a developer, I hope to build tools and experiences that make life easier,
                                 more inclusive, and a bit more enjoyable for everyone.</p>
